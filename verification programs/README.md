# RISC-V Verification Programs

Fallowing Verification Programs are used verify the design. The Programs are compiled using the RISC-V Toolchain for the 32 bit architecture and decompiled in to hex format so could be used to verify the design. The design Pass all the tests successfully.

# The Verification Programs

 * Add - For verify the implimentation succesfully decode and execute the programs
 * Count - For verify looping
 * Sum - For verify function call
 * Fibonacci - For verify recursion

### Notable Mentions
Most of the Verification Programs are modified version of Verification Programs written by undergraduates who undertook the project of implementing a RISC-V processor as thire final year project on year 2016 at the University of Moratuwa,Sri Lanka
